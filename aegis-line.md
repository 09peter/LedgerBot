## What is the Crusade Ledger?

The Crusade Ledger is your single source for every battle report, lore snippet, and narrative moment shared on our role‑playing Discord server. When the Game Master or a player marks a message with 📜, our **LedgerBot** automatically captures it and publishes it here in chronological order. No scattered threads — just one living chronicle.

## Who We Are

- **Playgroup**: Sledgehammer Wargaming (Vienna, Austria)  
- **Crusade Name**: The Aegis Line  
- **Alliances**: Imperium • Traitor Legions • Xenos  
- **Participants**: Game Master & players shaping the story.

## A Glimpse of the Lore

> “There is a place... where the stars once bled.”
>
> “They are not just worlds. They are memories carved in stone. Warnings. Oaths. Graves. They are the Aegis Line.”

Four bastion worlds on the edge of Imperial space—Thanovar, Vallak’s Spite, Gorgomire, and Saint Alyssia’s Vigil—stand united against darkness. Each fortress is forged in blood and bound by sacrifice:

- **Thanovar, the Iron Throne**: Its ancient guns never rest; its vaults run deeper than memory.
- **Vallak’s Spite**: A hellish forge world of molten rivers and obsidian strongholds.
- **Gorgomire, the Silent Grave**: Mist‑shrouded trenches and fields of ash where the dead become walls.
- **Saint Alyssia’s Vigil**: A frozen shrine where a single eternal flame embodies hope.

### The Turning of the Tide

When the Daemon Legions of Khorne—led by Tharok the Slaughter Lord—ravaged the Line, hope faded. Bastions fell, and millions perished under the Blood God’s wrath. In the darkest hour, the Sons of Aegis descendent, led by Chapter Master Castor Minea, and together with Lord Commander Lucien Drayke, they banished Tharok in a blazing finale atop Thanovar’s shattered spires. Their sacrifice named this line and inspires every entry in this ledger.
