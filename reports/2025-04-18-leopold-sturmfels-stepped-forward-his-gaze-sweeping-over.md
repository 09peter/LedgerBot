Leopold Sturmfels stepped forward, his gaze sweeping over his men. The echoes of battle still lingered in the air, a testament to their hard-fought struggle. With a resolute voice, he began his address:

“Brothers, as we stand on the brink of victory at Malachai, we find ourselves betrayed by the very forces we swore to serve. Political manipulation and treachery within the Imperium have cast a shadow over our hard-fought triumph. We have been given new orders, not in the spirit of victory, but as a result of deceit and hidden agendas. We must withdraw, not because we are defeated, but because we have been outmaneuvered by those who fear our strength. Let this be a reminder: we are the Black Templars. We will endure, and we will return. For Dorn and for the Emperor!”
