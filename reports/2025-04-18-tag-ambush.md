**The Saint Who Stood**

There are places in the Imperium where history is buried beneath stone and silence. The Aegis Line is not one of them.

It remembers, in scars and hymns
It remembers, in rusted shells and blood-soaked ash.

And it remembers him: he who stood when all else fell.

His name is lost to time, eroded by warp storms, redacted by inquisitorial seals and drowned in the endless war that followed. Yet his legacy endures in every whispered prayer, every bolter raised in defiance. The Martyr-Saint of Thanovar.

In life, a commander. In death, a symbol. 

It was he who rallied the last of the broken line when the Archenemy tore through the veil. He who held the breach until the skies turned to fire, and who, -it is said- struck down a prince of the warp with his dying breath.

Where he fell, a shrine was raised, humble in stone but unshakable in spirit. The Ecclesiarchy would later canonize him in silence. The faithful built around it. And the survivors? They stayed. Their descendants took up arms, inherited regimental codes and heirloom lasguns. In time, they became more than guards at the Aegis Line. They *became* the Aegis Line.
