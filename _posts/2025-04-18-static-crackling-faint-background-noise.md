Static crackling, faint background noise]…

“This is Supreme Commander Flametide… transmitting for the last time… 

[static noise]…

The Drukhari have come at us with all their hate and malice, but they are not unbreakable. Their forces are splintering, their numbers thinning. 

[Interference]…

Though I will not live to see the end, I know the T’au will rise victorious. The Greater Good has brought us this far, and it will carry us to the finish. 


[Static, low hum]… 

Torchwalker, you are now the flame that will lead us to that victory. Rally our warriors, show them the strength that flows through us all. We have the power to drive these wretched enemies from our path. Push forward with all your might. Victory is within reach, and it is ours for the taking. 

[Radio hiss]… 

Torchwalker… you are now the acting Supreme Commander and I have no doubt you will lead with the honor and strength our people deserve. It has been an honor. 

[Brief silence, soft static]…

Flametide… out.”

[Final crackling, followed by a long silence, then faint static fades]…
