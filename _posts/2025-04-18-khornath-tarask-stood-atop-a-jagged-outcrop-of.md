Khornath Tarask stood atop a jagged outcrop of blackened rock, the smoldering ruins of war stretching endlessly beneath him. The sky was stained crimson, the air thick with the lingering scent of blood and fire. His warriors roared in victory behind him, yet he remained still, his gaze locked on the void above.

High in the dark heavens, massive Necron warships, cold and unfeeling, drifted silently toward the edges of the system. No retreat. No surrender. They simply left, their purpose unknowable, their reasons hidden behind the eternal silence of their kind.

Khornath exhaled, gripping the haft of his twin axes. This was not how their war was meant to end. Not like this.

He did not curse. He did not rage. Instead, he simply watched.

"So you leave, Razatekh. Without a word, without an answer. The only foe who ever denied me. The only one ever worthy."

The Necron ships faded, swallowed by the abyss of space. The battlefield was his, yet for the first time, victory felt hollow.

"I will remember you, machine-king. My greatest enemy. The only one I have ever respected."

His grip tightened. His warriors cheered behind him, but he did not turn. His gaze remained fixed on the void, where his greatest rival had vanished.

"Go then. But know thisâ€”I will wait. And when the stars burn, I will find you again."
