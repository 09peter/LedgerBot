**The Wardens and the War to Come**
A detachment of the Malin Prime 103rd first came to the Line - not by edict or tithe, but by choice. Lord Keldon himself answered a fractured astropathic plea, leading elements of the 103rd through warp-ravaged space to reinforce a line long thought broken.

Where the Saint had held, they dug in, in support of Sisters of Battle, a Space Marine Successor Chapter and AdMech brethren.

Elements of the Malin Prime 103rd now form an integral part of the Line’s defense. Their presence is quiet, efficient, enduring - as is the Line. 

Among them, Commander Varik Hesk leads a force built for modern war: Hesk’s Wardens are a mechanized spearhead forged in the disciplined fury of Malin Prime, tasked with rapid response, armored breakthroughs, and battlefield control. His tanks carry no heraldry beyond burn-scars and kill-markings. Their roar is the only warning most enemies receive.

When Arch Logolector issued the call to arms, the 103rd did not hesitate. They did not require justifications. Their treads already carved trenches in the black stone of Thanovar. Their maps already marked the forgotten paths between bastions. Their dead were already buried in the same soil the Saint had bled into.

Hesk's Wardens are not zealots. The 103rd fights for the Line not because of oaths or relics, but because they know what happens when it falls. 

And so they dig in.

Whatever force rises to challenge the Aegis Line, be it daemon, xenos, or traitor - they will find the Malin Prime 103rd waiting. In the shadow of a nameless Saint, beneath the silent statues of Thanovar, they will hold. And they will not break.
