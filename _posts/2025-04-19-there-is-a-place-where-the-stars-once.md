“There is a place... where the stars once bled.”

More than a millennia ago a wound tore open at the edge of the Imperium. And from it… came rage.
Not war. Not rebellion but Daemons.
The Legions of Khorne poured into the Materium. Led by a mighty Blood thirster.
Tharok… The Slaughter Lord.
The Blood Legions swept across the stars burning every world in their path. Killing every living being. Showing mercy to no one. All in the name of the Blood God. 

But four Worlds did not fall. 

Four Fortress Worlds – ancient, bastioned, battered – held against the Legions of the Blood God. 

For days the worlds were besieged by the Daemons. The Astra Militarum, led by Lord Commander Lucien Drayke, stood firm against the hordes of the neverborn. But it was not enough. Millions had fallen to Bloodlust of the Daemons. In their darkest hour, with hope drowning beneath the weight of the neverborn…
A light descended.
The heavens split—not with fire, but with salvation.
The Sons of Aegis arrived.
Led by Chapter master Castor Minea they descended like a storm, and the tide began to turn. On the final day, atop the shattered spires of Thanovar, Chapter Master Castor Minea faced The Slaughter Lord in single combat. Steel met fury.
Faith met rage.  Their duel tore the sky open once more—but the daemon's fury was greater. Castor fell, broken beneath the slaughter-axe. But as Tharok raised his weapon for the final blow, Lord Commander Lucien Drayke opened fire. Artillery batteries, orbital cannons, and tank regiments tore apart the greater Daemon. The Slaughter Lord was banished. Torn apart by faith, fire, and the will of a single man. Castor was dead.
Tharok was gone.
The last of the daemons were hunted down and purged.
And after many days of endless war—it was over.

The Sons of Aegis had turned the tide.
They had saved the line.
But none of them returned.
Not one.
In honor of their sacrifice, the line was named after them—The Aegis Line.
